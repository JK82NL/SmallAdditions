## How it works

#### Crop harvest
By giving a player or group the permission _smalladd.crop.*_ (or any of the separate crops permissions), the player can right-click harvest crops. The seeds will be auto-replanted. If the drops contain the seeds, the seed will be taken out of the drop and if the drops don't contain it, then the seed will be taken out of the players' inventory. If the players' inventory doesn't contain any seeds, the crop won't be replanted.

_Crop harvest now has animations! New gif incoming._

#### Custom recipes
Why craft planks and then chests, if you can craft chests directly from logs!

**New:** now you can also dye carpets!

#### No crop trample
By giving a player or group the permission _smalladd.notrample_, the player or group can't trample any of the crops.

#### Workbench
By giving a player or group the permission _smalladd.tool.workbech_, the player can use the _/portableworkbench_ (or _/pwb_) to rename the workbench in hand into "Portable Workbench". When the player right-clicks on that workbench, crafting menu opens.
